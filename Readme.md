## 🎯 Project Objectives
- 🕵️ Extract flight schedules, pricing, and other relevant information from British airline websites.
- 🤖 Automate data collection using web scraping techniques.
- 📊 Organize the data for further analysis or visualization.
- ⚖️ Ensure ethical scraping by adhering to website terms of service.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **🖥️ Programming Language**: Python
- **📚 Libraries**:
  - `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` 🌐: For HTML parsing and sending HTTP requests.
  - `pandas` 🗂️: For organizing and processing scraped data.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` 📊: For visualizing trends in scraped data.
  - `time` and `random` ⏱️: To introduce delays and mimic human behavior.
- **📘 Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and execution.

---

## ⚙️ Data Extraction Workflow
1. **🌐 Send HTTP Requests**: Use the `requests` library to fetch HTML content from the target website.
2. **🧹 Parse HTML**: Use `BeautifulSoup` to extract specific elements like flight details, prices, and schedules.
3. **📊 Organize Data**: Clean and structure the extracted data into a tabular format using `pandas`.
4. **💾 Export Data**: Save the cleaned data as a CSV file for further analysis.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🤖 Automated Scraping**:
  - Extract flight details such as:
    - ⏰ Departure and arrival times.
    - 💸 Ticket prices (economy, business, etc.).
    - 🔖 Available discounts or offers.
- **📜 Dynamic Data Handling**:
  - Handles multiple pages of flight information dynamically.
- **🛡️ Error Handling**:
  - Includes try-except blocks to manage errors like failed requests or missing elements.
- **📈 Data Visualization**:
  - Visualizes trends such as average ticket prices over time or by destination.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.7+ 🐍.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib seaborn


## 📊 Results and Insights
- **📄 Collected Data**: Flight details, including ticket prices, schedules, and destinations.
- **📈 Sample Analysis**:
  - ✈️ Average ticket price for popular routes.
  - 🕰️ Distribution of flights by time of day (morning, afternoon,    evening).
- **📊 Visualizations**:
  - Bar charts and scatter plots to uncover patterns in pricing and availability.


## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- 🚀 Implement scraping for additional airline websites to expand the dataset.
- 🧑‍💻 Use Selenium for handling dynamic JavaScript-based pages.
